\section{Fighter Martial Archetypes:}
\subsection{Diehard}
You are as stalwart, hardy, and driven as can be imagined. When others are ready to quit, you’re just getting started.

\subsection{Ideas}
rapid recovery? - more hit dice to heal on short rest or +something to the healing on dice used
check against poison and psychics is with advantage
Advantage on death saves
no exhaustion when travelling
Easier travelling over cumbersome terrain
Where's the damage? Could be a real problem.

\subsubsection{3rd level - Never say die!}
Whenever damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 12). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You cannot use this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by a  critical hit.
Once you use this feature 2 times, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

\subsubsection{10th level}

\subsubsection{15th level}

\subsubsection{18th level}
At level 18th, you resilience even put deaths door at bay.
